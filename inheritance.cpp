/*
Assume the existence of a Window class with a function getWidth that returns the width of the window. Define a derived class WindowWithBorder that contains a single additional integer instance variable named borderWidth, and has a constructor that accepts an integer parameter which is used to initialize the instance variable. There is also a function getUseableWidth, that returns the width of the window minus the width of the border.
